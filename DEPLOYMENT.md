## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Vercel)

### 1. Push to Main Branch
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Vercel Auto-Deploys
- Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app on every push to `main`.
- You can monitor deployment status at https://vercel.com/

### 3. Production URL
- Your production app will be available at your Vercel-assigned domain, e.g.:
  - https://stars-vacation-management-h88osexjl-pierres-projects-bba7ee64.vercel.app

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables in the **Vercel Dashboard**:

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Navigate to **Settings > Environment Variables**
3. Add your environment variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (your Vercel production URL)
   - `GMAIL_USER`
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
   - `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (JSON string)

## 📝 Important Notes

- ✅ API routes (`/api/*`) are handled by Vercel serverless functions
- ✅ Firestore is used for data storage
- ✅ All Tailwind CSS and TypeScript issues resolved

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
2. **Environment variables missing**: Set them in Vercel dashboard
3. **Build errors**: All resolved ✅

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

Your app is now ready for Vercel deployment. All build issues have been resolved:
