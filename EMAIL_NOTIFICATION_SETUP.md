## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "SMTP env vars missing" Error
- Ensure all SMTP environment variables are set
- Check for typos in variable names
- Verify values are not empty

#### Email Not Sending
- Check Gmail app password is correct
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account
- Verify SMTP settings (host, port, security)

#### Conflicts Not Detected
- Check Firebase connection
- Verify vacation request data structure
- Check console logs for error messages

### Debug Mode
The system logs detailed information to help troubleshoot:

## Security Notes

- **No secrets in code**: All credentials stored in environment variables
- **Admin-only access**: Conflict detection and email sending require admin privileges
- **Gmail security**: Uses app passwords, not main account passwords
- **HTTPS required**: Production URLs must use HTTPS for security

## Next Steps

Once this system is working:
1. **Enable Firebase integration** for real data persistence
2. **Add email templates** for different notification types
3. **Implement status change notifications** (approved/rejected)
4. **Add email preferences** for admins
5. **Create notification dashboard** for admin review
