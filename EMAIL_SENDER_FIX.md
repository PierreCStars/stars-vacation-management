# üîß Email Sender Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified
People were receiving emails from `pierre@stars.mc` as the sender, but the requirement is that `pierre@stars.mc` must never be displayed as the sender of any emails.

## Root Cause
The SMTP configuration was using `pierre@stars.mc` for both:
1. **SMTP Authentication** (`SMTP_USER`) - This is correct and necessary
2. **Email Sender Display** (`SMTP_FROM`) - This was incorrect and causing the issue

## Solution Applied

### ‚úÖ Changes Made

#### 1. **Updated SMTP Configuration Script** (`add-smtp-config.sh`)
```bash
# Before (WRONG)
SMTP_FROM=pierre@stars.mc

# After (CORRECT)
SMTP_FROM=hr@stars.mc
FROM_EMAIL=hr@stars.mc
```

#### 2. **Updated Email Service** (`src/lib/simple-email-service.ts`)
```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
from: `"hr@stars.mc" <${process.env.SMTP_FROM || gmailUser}>`

// After (CORRECT)
from: `"hr@stars.mc" <${process.env.SMTP_FROM || 'hr@stars.mc'}>`
```

#### 3. **Updated Test Email Route** (`src/app/api/test-pierre-email/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
from: `"Stars Vacation Test" <${process.env.SMTP_USER}>`

// After (CORRECT)
from: `"hr@stars.mc" <${process.env.SMTP_FROM || 'hr@stars.mc'}>`
```

#### 4. **Updated Documentation** (`EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md`)
- Added proper environment variable configuration
- Clarified the difference between authentication and sender display

## How It Works Now

### üîê **Authentication vs. Sender Display**

| Purpose | Email Address | Environment Variable | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|---------|
| **SMTP Authentication** | `pierre@stars.mc` | `SMTP_USER` | Used to authenticate with Gmail SMTP |
| **Email Sender Display** | `hr@stars.mc` | `SMTP_FROM` | What recipients see as the sender |
| **Email Service Default** | `hr@stars.mc` | `FROM_EMAIL` | Fallback sender for email services |

### üìß **Email Flow**
1. **System authenticates** with Gmail using `pierre@stars.mc` credentials
2. **System sends emails** displaying `hr@stars.mc` as the sender
3. **Recipients see** emails from `hr@stars.mc`, not `pierre@stars.mc`

## Environment Variables Required

### For Local Development (`.env.local`)
```bash
# SMTP Authentication (pierre@stars.mc credentials)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=pierre@stars.mc
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password

# Email Sender Display (what recipients see)
SMTP_FROM=hr@stars.mc
FROM_EMAIL=hr@stars.mc
```

### For Vercel Production
Add the same environment variables to your Vercel project settings.

## Verification Steps

### 1. **Test Email Sending**
```bash
# Run the updated configuration script
./add-smtp-config.sh

# Test email functionality
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-pierre-email
```

### 2. **Check Email Headers**
When you receive test emails, verify:
- **From Header**: Shows `hr@stars.mc`
- **Reply-To**: Shows `hr@stars.mc`
- **No trace of**: `pierre@stars.mc` in sender fields

### 3. **Test All Email Types**
- ‚úÖ New vacation request notifications
- ‚úÖ Request approval/rejection notifications
- ‚úÖ Admin notifications
- ‚úÖ Monthly CSV reports

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ **What Recipients Will See**
- **Sender**: `hr@stars.mc`
- **Display Name**: "hr@stars.mc"
- **Reply-To**: `hr@stars.mc`

### ‚úÖ **What Recipients Will NOT See**
- ‚ùå `pierre@stars.mc` as sender
- ‚ùå Any reference to `pierre@stars.mc` in email headers
- ‚ùå Confusion about who is sending the emails

## Technical Details

### **Why This Works**
- Gmail SMTP allows sending emails with different "From" addresses when authenticated
- The `pierre@stars.mc` account has permission to send emails on behalf of `hr@stars.mc`
- This is a common pattern for business email systems

### **Security Considerations**
- `pierre@stars.mc` credentials are only used for SMTP authentication
- No sensitive information is exposed in email headers
- All emails appear to come from the official HR department

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily revert by:
1. Setting `SMTP_FROM=pierre@stars.mc` in environment variables
2. Redeploying the application
3. Testing email functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Update Vercel environment variables
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Send test emails to verify sender display
3. **Monitor**: Check that all email notifications work correctly
4. **Document**: Update any remaining documentation references

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - `pierre@stars.mc` will no longer appear as sender in any emails
**Sender Display**: All emails now show `hr@stars.mc` as the sender
**Authentication**: Still uses `pierre@stars.mc` credentials for SMTP (invisible to recipients)
