# Email Template Fix - Resolved âœ…

## Issue Identified
When sending admin notification emails for vacation requests, the person's name was showing as "undefined" in the email content.

## Root Cause
The email templates were trying to use `vacationRequest.userName`, but this field was not being sent from the frontend form. The `userName` should come from the authenticated user's session data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Email Template Format
Updated the admin vacation email templates to match the exact format requested:

**Text Version:**
```
Hello Admin,

Full-day vacation request from {Name of the person requesting} from {company}.
Dates required {start date} to {end date}

Check for conflicts before reviewing the request.

Thank you!

The vacation system
```

**HTML Version:**
- Same content with proper HTML formatting
- Maintains the Stars Group branding
- Includes the review button

### 2. Fixed Data Source
Updated the API endpoint (`/api/vacation-requests`) to:
- Use `session.user.name` from the authenticated session
- Fallback to `session.user.email` if name is not available
- Fallback to "Unknown User" as last resort

### 3. Improved Date Format
Changed date range display from "â†’" to "to" for better readability:
- Before: `2025-01-15 â†’ 2025-01-17`
- After: `2025-01-15 to 2025-01-17`

## Code Changes Made

### `src/lib/email-templates.ts`
- Updated `adminVacationText()` function with new format
- Updated `adminVacationHtml()` function with new format
- Improved half-day vs full-day detection and display

### `src/app/api/vacation-requests/route.ts`
- Fixed `userName` data source to use session user data
- Added proper fallback logic for missing user names
- Maintained all existing functionality

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and tested:
- âœ… Email templates now use correct user names from session
- âœ… Format matches the exact specification requested
- âœ… Half-day vs full-day detection works correctly
- âœ… Company names are properly displayed
- âœ… Date ranges are formatted as requested

## Result
Admin notification emails now correctly display:
- **Hello Admin** (greeting)
- **{Type of Vacation} request from {Name of the person requesting} from {company}**
- **Dates required {start date} to {end date}**
- **Check for conflicts before reviewing the request**
- **Thank you!**
- **The vacation system**

The undefined userName issue has been completely resolved! ðŸŽ¯
